# Gatus alerting webhook — disabled 2026-04-28 after fourth pipeline storm in 5 weeks.
# Empty token gates the entire alerting block + per-endpoint alerts entries off
# (see namespaces/gatus/main.tf). Status page now relies on the 5-min schedule
# plus client-side /api/mesh-stats and /api/service-health polling. See
# kyriakos/AUDIT-2026-04-28.md for the post-mortem.
